# Linked List

## Difficulties

### Easy
- Reverse Linked List
- Merge Two Sorted Lists
- Linked List Cycle

### Medium
- Reorder List
- Remove Nth Node From End of List
- Copy List With Random Pointer
- Add Two Numbers
- Find The Duplicate Number
- LRU Cache

### Hard
- Merge K Sorted Lists
- Reverse Nodes In K Group

## Patterns
- Nodes connected by **next pointer**
- No random access, only **sequential traversal**
- Requires **pointer manipulation**
- Uses **head, tail, and current pointers**
- Frequent use of **dummy node**
- Frequent use of **slow and fast pointers**
- Asked to **reverse a list**
- Asked to reverse a **portion of a list**
- Asked to **detect a cycle**
- Asked to find **middle node**
- Asked to **merge two lists**
- Asked to **remove or delete nodes**
- Asked to **reorder nodes**
- Asked to **partition list**
- Asked to check **palindrome**
- Asked to find **intersection of two lists**
- Asked to **add numbers represented as lists**
- Asked to **copy list with random pointer**
- Requires careful handling of **null pointers**
- Requires updating **next references correctly**
- Involves **in-place modification**
- Traversal often **one pass or two passes**
- Requires tracking **previous node**
- Uses recursion in some problems
- Edge cases with **single node list**
- Edge cases with **empty list**
- Often combined with **two pointers**
- Avoids extra space when possible
- Bugs often come from **losing references**
- Final list often returned via **dummy.next**
